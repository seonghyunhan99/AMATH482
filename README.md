## Course Description
Exploratory and objective data analysis methods applied to the physical, engineering, and biologi-
cal sciences. Brief review of statistical methods and their computational implementation for studying time series analysis,
spectral analysis, filtering methods, principal component analysis, orthogonal mode decomposition, and image processing
and compression.

## Repository Introduction
This repository is comprised of personal solutions to the homework assignments pertaining to this class. The assignments
cover topics outlined by the course description above along with basic development of neural network algorithms for classification.
Computational analyses and algorithm development was carried out in MATLAB 9.3 R2017b for Homework 1 - 4 and in Python 3 for
Homework 5.
