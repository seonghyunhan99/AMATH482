## Course Description
Exploratory and objective data analysis methods applied to the physical, engineering, and biological sciences. Brief review of statistical methods and their computational implementation for studying time series analysis, spectral analysis, filtering methods, principal component analysis, orthogonal mode decomposition, and image processing and compression. ([link][6])

## Repository Introduction
This repository is comprised of personal solutions to the homework assignments pertaining to this class. The assignments cover topics outlined by the course description above along with basic development of neural network algorithms for classification. Computational analyses and algorithm development were carried out in MATLAB 9.3 for Homework 1 - 4 and in Python 3 for Homework 5. Each of the homework folders contains a solution document as a PDF file and a code document as either .m or .ipynb files. The solutions documents contain information regarding the theoretical background and how the algorithm was developed for the assignments which should enable others to reference, reproduce, and modify the content. *The homework problem statements and theoretical background information are attributed to the course professor and sources in the References section of the solutions documents.*

*This project is maintained and contributed by self.*
